Notes:

The node modules are shared by tmp36.js and brew_temp.js. I need to merge plotly stuff from tmp36.js into brew_temp.js.

Note that the node_modules folder is included in .gitignore. When cloning this project, be sure to run `npm install plotly` and 'npm install johnny-five' inside of /nodejs_plotly folder.
