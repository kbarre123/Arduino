Notes on Libraries:

* To use the Seeedstudio 2.8" touchscreen, I had to download the Adafruit library
    entitled "TouchScreen". However, the examples are for the v2 version of the 
    shield. So, I also had to download the TouchShield version from Seeedstudio on 
    Github. Those sketches were for my version, but a few changes need to be made,
    as the Adafruit library was updated. Forvexample, in the 'paint' example sketch, 
    Point needed to be changed to TSPoint.
